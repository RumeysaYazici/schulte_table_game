The Schulte Table Game includes;
- A grid with numbers from one to 25 on it,
- A stopwatch that starts as soon as you hit a number, 
- A line that holds the last pressed number, 
- A line that holds the best score, 
- An information box that appears and says 'Yes! IT IS FINISHED! "Total Time: x hours x minutes x seconds"' when the game ends,
- A button called 'RESET AND PLAY AGAIN!' that will replace the numbers on the boxes again, and reset the game and the stopwatch.
